	<h1>CHAPTER 21 filmclip</h1>
<h3>SYNOPSIS: Meanwhile, back in Siccarebath...whispers spread, whispers of insurrection.
It had been said long ago that Sir Marvos would one day take the throne and remove the weak link that would break the chain of the House of Daugalias!
Word had also spread that Sir Marvos failed his first campaign against Kylar on purpose, leaving a smoldering path of destruction behind him...if that were to be so,
then we all know what Ruke will do. He arrived at the inner chambers of Siccarebath. Ruke; the infamous Prince of the House of Daugalias, oppressor of Zamaria,
has hatched new plans to turn his little dynasty into a world power.</h3>
